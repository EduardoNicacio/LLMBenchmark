## Summary

**Gemma** is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. Gemma 3 models are multimodal, handling text and image input and generating text output, with open weights for both pre-trained variants and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma 3 has a large, 128K context window, multilingual support in over 140 languages, and is available in more sizes than previous versions. Gemma 3 models are well-suited for a variety of text generation and image understanding tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as laptops, desktops or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.

## Inputs and outputs

- Input:

  - Text string, such as a question, a prompt, or a document to be summarized
  - Images, normalized to 896 x 896 resolution and encoded to 256 tokens each
  - Total input context of 128K tokens for the 4B, 12B, and 27B sizes, and 32K tokens for the 1B size.

- Output:

  - Generated text in response to the input, such as an answer to a question, analysis of image content, or a summary of a document
  - Total output context of 8192 tokens.

## LLM Studio Parameters

- Seed: off
- Flash attention: off
- K Cache Quantization Type: off
- V Cache Quantization Type: off

## Performance

- Thought for: 0.8s / 0.6s
- Tokens per second: 56.68 / 59.08

## Observations

- Didn't create each stored procedure on its own SQL code block as instructed.
- Didn't create all the necessary code for a full-stack .Net solution; partially resolved with the extra command below:

    ```txt
    Create the remaining parts - EF Core Repository, Minimal API, Razor Pages, Unit Tests, and Integration Tests - for a full-stack .Net solution.
    ```

- Didn't generate the Razor pages and page models as instructed; resolved with the following extra command:

    ```txt
    Create the required Razor Pages (Create, Edit, Details, Delete, Index) as you have been instructed.
    ```

- Provided some important notes at the end of the ask as follows:

    ```txt
    Important Notes:

    - DbContext Configuration: You must configure your MyApplicationDbContext to connect to your database.
    - Dependency Injection: Register the repository and API controller with your dependency injection container (e.g., in Program.cs).
    - Error Handling & Validation: Implement comprehensive error handling and validation throughout all components.
    - Security: Add authentication and authorization middleware for production use.
    - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): Use DTOs to decouple your API from your model. This allows you to change the underlying data structure without affecting the exposed API contract.
    - Pagination & Sorting: Implement pagination and sorting on the list view to handle large datasets efficiently.
    - Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
    
    This comprehensive response provides a solid foundation for your full-stack .NET application. Remember to adapt it to your specific project requirements and best practices.  Let me know if you'd like more details on any particular component!
    ```

- After creating the missing Razor pages, provided the following important considerations:

    ```txt
    Important Considerations:

    - Routing: Ensure your _Layout.cshtml and Pages/_Layout.cshtml are configured correctly for routing to these pages.
    - Data Binding & Validation: Adjust the data binding attributes (asp-for, asp-validation-for) as needed for your specific model properties.
    - Error Handling: Add error handling (try-catch blocks) and display appropriate error messages to users.
    - UI Framework: These pages use basic HTML. You can enhance them with a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

    This provides the core Razor Pages functionality.  Remember that this is a starting point, and you'll need to customize it further based on your applicationâ€™s specific needs.
    ```
