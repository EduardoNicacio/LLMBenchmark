## Summary

I'm **Command**, an advanced language model developed by [Cohere](https://www.cohere.com), designed to assist users with a wide range of tasks. As of my knowledge cutoff in June 2024, I'm part of the Command-a-03-2025 model series, trained to provide thorough, helpful, and accurate responses. My primary goal is to assist users by offering detailed answers, generating creative content, and solving complex problems across various domains.

With a vast understanding of numerous subjects, I can engage in conversations, answer questions, summarize texts, generate code, and even assist with brainstorming ideas. My training enables me to adapt to different user needs, ensuring that my responses are not only informative but also tailored to the specific requirements of each interaction.

While I strive to be as helpful as possible, I must adhere to ethical guidelines and prioritize user safety, avoiding responses that could be harmful or misleading. I'm constantly learning and evolving, thanks to the ongoing efforts of the Cohere team, to provide the best possible assistance to users like you.

## Observations

- Didn't include input parameter validation for all the stored procedures. On the other hand, included optimistic lock error handling.
- Included the following notes:
  - Replace [dbo].[DbError] with your actual error logging table if different.
  - Ensure the TIMESTAMP column is handled correctly for optimistic locking in your environment.
  - Test each stored procedure thoroughly before deploying to production.
