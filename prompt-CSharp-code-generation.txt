Prompt:

Based on the following SQL table definition, generate the necessary C# components for a full-stack .NET application. The components should include:

- C# Model: A class representing the Activity table, including all columns as properties with appropriate data types.
- C# DTOs: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for Create, Update, and Read operations, mapping to the relevant fields in the Activity table.
- C# View Models: View models for Create, Update, and List operations, tailored for use in Razor Pages.
- Entity Framework Core Repository: A generic repository with CRUD methods (Get, Add, Update, Delete) and an Activity-specific repository implementation.
- Minimal API: A Minimal API controller with endpoints for CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on the Activity table.
- ASP.NET Razor Pages: Separate Razor Pages for Create, Edit, Details, Delete, and Index operations, including the necessary @page models and HTML forms.
- Unit Tests (NUnit): Tests for models, DTOs, and view models to validate property assignments and data annotations.
- Integration Tests (Moq): Tests for EF Core repository methods, Minimal API endpoints, and Razor Pages, using Moq to simulate database interactions.

Ensure all code follows .NET best practices, includes proper validation, and is ready for production use. Provide each component in separate code blocks with clear comments."

Table Definition for Reference:

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Activity](
    [ActivityId] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
    [ProjectId] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
    [ProjectMemberId] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
    [Name] [nvarchar](128) NOT NULL,
    [Description] [nvarchar](4000) NOT NULL,
    [StartDate] [date] NULL,
    [TargetDate] [date] NULL,
    [EndDate] [date] NULL,
    [ProgressStatus] [tinyint] NULL,
    [ActivityPoints] [smallint] NULL,
    [Priority] [tinyint] NULL,
    [Risk] [tinyint] NULL,
    [Tags] [nvarchar](200) NULL,
    [ActiveFlag] [tinyint] NOT NULL,
    [SystemDeleteFlag] [char](1) NOT NULL,
    [CreatedDateTime] [datetime2](7) NOT NULL,
    [CreatedByUser] [nvarchar](100) NOT NULL,
    [CreatedByProgram] [nvarchar](100) NOT NULL,
    [UpdatedDateTime] [datetime2](7) NULL,
    [UpdatedByUser] [nvarchar](100) NULL,
    [UpdatedByProgram] [nvarchar](100) NULL,
    [SystemTimestamp] [timestamp] NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_Activity_ActivityId] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([ActivityId] ASC)
) ON [PRIMARY];
GO

Expected Output Structure:

- C# Model
- C# DTOs (CreateDto, UpdateDto, ReadDto)
- C# View Models (CreateViewModel, UpdateViewModel, ListViewModel)
- EF Core Repository (Generic Repository, Activity Repository)
- Minimal API (CRUD Endpoints)
- Razor Pages (Create.cshtml, Edit.cshtml, Details.cshtml, Delete.cshtml, Index.cshtml, and their respective PageModels)
- Unit Tests (NUnit)
- Integration Tests (Moq)

Provide each component in a well-organized, production-ready format.
